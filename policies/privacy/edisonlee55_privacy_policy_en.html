            <a href="edisonlee55_privacy_policy_zh-TW.html">中文版</a>
            <p>Last modified: November 11, 2017</p>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy explains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What information we collect and why we collect it.</li>
                <li>How we use that information.</li>
                <li>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Information we collect</h3>
            <p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which
                language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful.</p>
            <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Device information</strong>
                </li>
                <p>We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device
                    identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number).</p>
                <li>
                    <strong>Log information</strong>
                </li>
                <p>When you use our services or view content provided by Edison Lee, we automatically collect and store certain
                    information in server logs. </p>
                <li>
                    <strong>Location information</strong>
                </li>
                <p>When you use Edison Lee services, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We use
                    various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for
                    example, provide Edison Lee with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.</p>
                <li>
                    <strong>Unique application numbers</strong>
                </li>
                <p>Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation
                    (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Edison Lee when
                    you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as
                    for automatic updates.</p>
                <li>
                    <strong>Local storage</strong>
                </li>
                <p>We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms
                    such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.</p>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cookies and similar technologies</strong>
                </li>
                <p>We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Edison Lee
                    service, and this may include using cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device.</p>
            </ul>
            <h3>How we use information we collect</h3>
            <p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to
                develop new ones, and to protect Edison Lee and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored
                content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.</p>
            <p>When you contact Edison Lee, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing.
                We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes
                or improvements.</p>
            <p>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience
                and the overall quality of our services. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able
                to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate
                an identifier from cookies or similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as those based on race,
                religion, sexual orientation or health.</p>
            <p>Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features,
                such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.</p>
            <p>We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other
                Edison Lee services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know. Depending on your
                settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order
                to improve Edison Lee’s services and the ads delivered by Edison Lee.</p>
            <p>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this
                Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Edison Lee processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your
                personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.</p>
            <h3>Information you share</h3>
            <p>Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly,
                it may be indexable by search engines. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing
                your content.</p>
            <h3>Accessing and updating your personal information</h3>
            <p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information
                is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information
                for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify
                your identity before we can act on your request.</p>
            <p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example,
                developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would
                be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).</p>
            <p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require
                a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental
                or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately
                delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.</p>
            <h3>Information we share</h3>
            <p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Edison Lee unless
                one of the following circumstances applies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>With your consent</strong>
                </li>
                <p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Edison Lee when
                    we have your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</p>
                <li>
                    <strong>For external processing</strong>
                </li>
                <p>We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for
                    us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality
                    and security measures.</p>
                <li>
                    <strong>For legal reasons</strong>
                </li>
                <p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Edison Lee if
                    we have a goodfaith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably
                    necessary to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</p>
            </ul>
            <p>We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers
                or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of
                our services.</p>
            <p>If Edison Lee is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality
                of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or
                becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
            <h3>Information security</h3>
            <p>We work hard to protect Edison Lee and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure
                or destruction of information we hold. In particular:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We encrypt many of our services using TLS.</li>
                <li>We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures,
                    to guard against unauthorized access to systems.</li>
                <li>We restrict access to personal information to Edison Lee employees, contractors and agents who need to know
                    that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality
                    obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When this Privacy Policy applies</h3>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Edison Lee and its affiliates, including services
                Edison Lee provides on mobile devices, and services offered on other sites (such as our advertising services),
                but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or
                sites that may be displayed to you in search results, sites that may include Edison Lee services, or other
                sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies
                and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies
                to serve and offer relevant ads.</p>
            <h3>Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities</h3>
            <p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self regulatory frameworks,
                including the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks. When we receive formal written complaints, we
                will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities,
                including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal
                data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.</p>
            <h3>Changes</h3>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without
                your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant,
                we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy
                changes).</p>
